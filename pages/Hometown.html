            <h2>Introduction</h2>

                part of the country at the foot of the Vitosha Mountain. It is one of 
                Europe's oldest cities, with a history dating back thousands of years.
                Here are some landmarks in Sofia:

            <h2>Local Culture</h2>
            <p>Sofia's local culture is a vibrant blend of ancient traditions and modern influences,
                reflecting its rich history and diverse heritage. As the cultural heart of Bulgaria, 
                the city celebrates a fusion of Thracian, Roman, Ottoman, and Slavic elements through 
                its architecture, cuisine, and festivals. Traditional Bulgarian music and dance, 
                characterized by intricate rhythms and costumes, are cherished and often performed 
                at events and cultural gatherings. Sofia's cultural institutions, such as the National
                Theater, National Palace of Culture (NDK), and numerous galleries, showcase both classical
                and contemporary art. The city's Orthodox Christian roots are evident in its many churches,
                most notably the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, while its multicultural history is mirrored in 
                landmarks like the Banya Bashi Mosque. Additionally, Sofia hosts a lively café culture, 
                where locals enjoy socializing over coffee or rakia, and the city's markets, such as the 
                Women’s Market (Zhenski Pazar), offer a glimpse into everyday life through local crafts, 
                produce, and delicacies.
