                    Visiting Germany was a remarkable journey through history and modernity. Starting in Berlin, I was awestruck by the remnants of the Berlin Wall and the bustling streets of Alexanderplatz. The Reichstag Building and Brandenburg Gate were mesmerizing, especially when lit up at night. In Bavaria, I explored the fairy-tale Neuschwanstein Castle and indulged in pretzels and Bavarian beer. The efficient public transportation made hopping between cities like Munich, Frankfurt, and Hamburg seamless. Germany's combination of medieval charm and cutting-edge innovation left a lasting impression.

                    Greece was a journey through ancient wonders and sun-soaked islands. Athens' Acropolis transported me back in time, while Plaka's narrow streets offered charming cafes and shops. Santorini's iconic white-washed buildings with blue domes were even more breathtaking in person, especially during sunset.

The food—souvlaki, moussaka, and baklava—was a delight, and the Greek hospitality made me feel at home.
