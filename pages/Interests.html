            <p>I enjoy playing volleyball, going for hikes, swimming during the summer months, and visiting the gym very often. Sports have always been an important part of my life, helping me stay active and healthy. Sports have also provided me with opportunities to meet new people and make new friends.</p>
            
            <h2>Music</h2>

            <p>I love listening to various music genres, from classic rock to modern pop. Music helps me unwind and express my emotions, especially when I'm in need of some energy or inspiration.</p>
            
            <h2>Reading</h2>
