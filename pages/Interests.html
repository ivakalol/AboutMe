            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p>I enjoy playing volleyball, going for hikes, and swimming during the summer months. Sports have always been an important part of my life, helping me stay active and healthy.</p>
            
            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>I love listening to various music genres, from classic rock to modern pop. Music helps me unwind and express my emotions, especially when I'm in need of some energy or inspiration.</p>
            
            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>Books are a great source of knowledge and entertainment for me. I enjoy reading novels, essays, and philosophical works during my spare time. It helps me broaden my perspectives and expand my imagination.</p>
            
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>Programming, web development, and exploring new technologies excite me. I'm always trying to learn something new or work on a personal project to further enhance my technical skills.</p>
